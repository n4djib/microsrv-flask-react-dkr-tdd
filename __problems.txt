=== P 28:

This registers a new command, recreate_db , to the CLI so that we can run it from the command
line. Apply the model to the dev database:

$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml \
    run users python manage.py recreate_db


Did this work? Let's hop into psql...
$ docker exec -ti $(docker ps -aqf "name=users-db") psql -U postgres

# \c users_dev
You are now connected to database "users_dev" as user "postgres".
